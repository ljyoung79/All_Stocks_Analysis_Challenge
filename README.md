# All_Stocks_Analysis_Challenge
## Project Overview
It is good to hear that the program for your stock review has been useful.  I have reviewed the program to see if there are any ways to make it run more efficiently, with more stock options for the future.  The refactored program will help you get the information you need on your selected stock option more quickly.  

### Results
With the refactored program I was able to pull the information needed in less than half the time it took to run the original program.  Please see the run times for both 2017 and 2018 below.

As you can see the refactored program was able to get the same information, but much more quickly.  

## Advantages & Disadvantages of Refactoring
There are many advantages to refactoring code.  One is that we are using tried and true methods that are known to work. Another is that using the same style through a program can make it easier for users to recognize the output.  
A disadvantage of refactoring code is that there are times that the data set may not match and the code may not run correctly.  

In this particular case refactoring has been very successful and only made the programming work better and more efficiently for you.  Refactoring will make it possible for you to find the necessary information much more quickly, even with a larger data set.

I hope that you are able to use this program for more stock comparison going forward.
