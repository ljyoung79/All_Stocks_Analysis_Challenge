# All_Stocks_Analysis_Challenge
## Project Overview
I am so glad that the macro created to help you review the stock information you selected.  I have reviewed the program created to see if there is a way to make it run more quickly, with more stock options for the future.  The refactored macro will help you get the information you need on the new stock options selected more quickly.  

### Results
With the refactored macro I was able to get your stock information in less then half the amount of time it took to run the original macro.  Please see the picktures below for the run times with both macro for both the 2017 and 2018 results.
