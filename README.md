# All_Stocks_Analysis_Challenge
## Project Overview
It is good to hear that the code for your stock review has been useful.  I have reviewed the code to see if there are any ways to make it run more efficiently, with more stock options for the future.  
### Results
With the refactored code I was able to pull the information needed in less than half the time it took to run the original code.  Please see the run times for both 2017 and 2018 below.

As you can see the refactored code was able to get the same information, but much more quickly.  

## Advantages of Refactoring Code
There are many advantages to refactoring code.  Though we are not adding new functionality, we are making the code for efficient so that it takes fewer steps and less memory.  It will also help if there are changes that need to be made to the code in the future with a more streamlined code.  It may also help if a new user needs to get involved with this code in the future. 

In this particular case refactoring has been very successful and only made the code more efficiently for your needs.  Refactoring will make it possible for you to find the necessary information much more quickly, even with a larger data set.

I hope that you are able to use this codefor more stock comparison going forward.
